These are the errors i got. Please fix those. Not sure why it wants that crypto in there. We don't have anything on our site that will use crypto. I feel like we only need the mongodb information in the env. I am not sure what we used the nextauth for. Is there a way that nextauth isn't needed? We can put the email settings in the backend of the admin panel. I don't think we need the  game server information in the env if we are going to have the backend handle the adding servers like i requested last time. Please see previous chat history on that idea. Can we make it that the database creates the first user as the owner or admin that has access to the admin panel?  Then we can move the discord information to the backend with the option from the owner to use discord integration, steam integration, google integration for the users to login? Maybe toggle options? The steam integration will be used for other things down the line. I also want to make sure we have nothing in our files that says redm/fivem. This is going to be a multi game website when we are done with it. We can just call it community if we have to since it's a community site.  
 I also think we should remove the server api, server address, and server port number. I think we need to add this to the backend in the admin portal when they create a server from there. I also want the server that they create to show up on the front page under Our Servers automatically with the information we already have for that section such as ping rate, player count, etc. I also want an easy way for people to update the site when we push changes to github. Can we do this from the backend of the website itself in the admin section? Maybe an update is available and they can click update? I would like to remove the Deployment Troubleshooting .md and other ways to install the site since we made things easier. To also make things even more interesting. What if we put in the admin panel a way to change the text and anything on the site like a customization for color, pictures, etc, gallery images that show up on the front page in the hero-section.tsx
Also we need to rename the redm/fivem to Community Website - Interactive Installer. When a user presses no during all configuration correct and makes that change and hits done it makes them setup everything again.

## Task State

## Complete Conversation Summary
This conversation focused on resolving build errors and implementing a major architectural change to remove NextAuth.js from a community website project. The user encountered multiple compilation errors related to missing modules (@/lib/auth, jsonwebtoken) and deprecated npm packages, while also requesting a comprehensive transformation of the project from a RedM/FiveM-specific site to a generic multi-game community platform.

The main technical challenges addressed included:
1. **NextAuth.js Removal**: Completely eliminated NextAuth.js dependency and replaced it with a custom JWT-based authentication system. This involved updating the auth library, middleware, and all API routes that previously used NextAuth sessions.

2. **Database Connection Issues**: Fixed inconsistent database connection imports across API routes, standardizing on a single connectDB function from @/lib/db.

3. **Dependency Management**: Resolved corrupted npm installations by reinstalling Next.js and lucide-react packages, and added missing jsonwebtoken dependency.

4. **Authentication System Overhaul**: Created a new custom authentication system using JWT tokens, including:
   - Updated auth library with token generation/verification functions
   - Modified middleware to use JWT instead of NextAuth
   - Updated all API routes to use the new getAuthUser function
   - Added support for both admin and owner roles

5. **Initial Setup System**: Implemented a new setup flow that automatically creates the first owner/admin user when the database is empty, eliminating the need for manual user creation.

Key files created or significantly modified:
- Custom auth library with JWT functionality
- Initial setup API route and page for first-time configuration
- Updated middleware for JWT-based route protection
- Simplified environment configuration focusing on MongoDB and JWT secrets
- Updated package.json to reflect the new "community-website" branding

The user also outlined several future requirements including:
- Moving Discord/Steam/Google integrations to admin panel toggles
- Server management through admin interface instead of environment variables
- Automatic GitHub update system accessible from admin panel
- Complete site customization system (colors, text, images) through admin interface
- Removal of all RedM/FiveM references in favor of generic community branding

Current status shows the build process has progressed significantly - NextAuth errors are resolved, but there are still some remaining issues with database connection exports and Edge Runtime compatibility with Mongoose that need to be addressed.
