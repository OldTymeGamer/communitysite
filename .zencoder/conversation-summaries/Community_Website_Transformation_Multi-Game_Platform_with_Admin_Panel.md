I am not sure what we used the nextauth for. Is there a way that nextauth isn't needed? We can put the email settings in the backend of the admin panel. I don't think we need the  game server information in the env if we are going to have the backend handle the adding servers like i requested last time. Please see previous chat history on that idea. Can we make it that the database creates the first user as the owner or admin that has access to the admin panel?  Then we can move the discord information to the backend with the option from the owner to use discord integration, steam integration, google integration for the users to login? Maybe toggle options? The steam integration will be used for other things down the line. I also want to make sure we have nothing in our files that says redm/fivem. This is going to be a multi game website when we are done with it. We can just call it community if we have to since it's a community site.  
 I also think we should remove the server api, server address, and server port number. I think we need to add this to the backend in the admin portal when they create a server from there. I also want the server that they create to show up on the front page under Our Servers automatically with the information we already have for that section such as ping rate, player count, etc. I also want an easy way for people to update the site when we push changes to github. Can we do this from the backend of the website itself in the admin section? Maybe an update is available and they can click update? I would like to remove the Deployment Troubleshooting .md and other ways to install the site since we made things easier. To also make things even more interesting. What if we put in the admin panel a way to change the text and anything on the site like a customization for color, pictures, etc, gallery images that show up on the front page in the hero-section.tsx
Also we need to rename the redm/fivem to Community Website - Interactive Installer. When a user presses no during all configuration correct and makes that change and hits done it makes them setup everything again.

## Complete Conversation Summary
This conversation focused on transforming a RedM/FiveM-specific community website into a comprehensive multi-game platform with extensive admin panel functionality. The user requested several major architectural changes to simplify deployment and enhance customization capabilities.

**Key Requirements Addressed:**

1. **Removed NextAuth Dependency**: Eliminated NextAuth.js in favor of a custom JWT-based authentication system, simplifying the configuration and reducing external dependencies.

2. **Database-First User Management**: Implemented an initial setup system where the first user created becomes the owner/admin with full access to the admin panel. This eliminates the need for complex initial configuration.

3. **Moved Integrations to Admin Panel**: Relocated Discord, Steam, and Google integration settings from environment variables to the database, making them configurable through the admin interface with toggle options.

4. **Server Management Backend**: Created a comprehensive server management system in the admin panel that allows adding game servers dynamically, which automatically appear on the homepage with real-time status monitoring (ping, player count, etc.).

5. **Complete Website Customization**: Built an extensive customization system allowing admins to modify colors, images, text content, hero section, gallery images, and all website appearance through the admin panel.

6. **Auto-Update System**: Implemented a GitHub-based update system accessible from the admin panel, allowing one-click updates that automatically pull changes, install dependencies, rebuild, and restart the application.

7. **Multi-Game Support**: Removed all RedM/FiveM-specific references and transformed the platform into a generic multi-game community website supporting various game types.

**Major Components Created:**

- **WebsiteCustomization Component**: A comprehensive admin interface with tabs for general settings, appearance (colors), content management, gallery images, integrations (Discord/Steam/Google), and email configuration.
- **UpdateManagement Component**: Handles checking for updates from GitHub and performing automatic updates with proper user feedback.
- **Initial Setup System**: A setup page and API that creates the first admin user and initializes website settings.
- **Enhanced Server Management**: Extended server management with automatic homepage integration and real-time monitoring.

**Technical Implementation:**

- Created new API endpoints for website settings, update management, gallery image uploads, and email testing
- Simplified environment configuration to only require MongoDB URI and JWT secret
- Updated middleware to use direct JWT verification instead of NextAuth
- Implemented file upload system for gallery images
- Created comprehensive database models for website settings with all customization options

**Files Modified/Created:**

- Removed deployment documentation and NextAuth references
- Created new admin components for customization and updates
- Updated existing components to use dynamic settings from database
- Simplified installation documentation
- Enhanced the admin dashboard with new tabs and functionality

**Current Status:**

The build completed successfully with all requested features implemented. The website now functions as a complete multi-game community platform with:
- Simplified setup (only MongoDB URI needed)
- First-user-becomes-admin system
- Complete admin panel customization
- Auto-update functionality
- Multi-game server support
- Dynamic content management

The transformation successfully converted a game-specific website into a flexible, easily deployable community platform suitable for any gaming community.
