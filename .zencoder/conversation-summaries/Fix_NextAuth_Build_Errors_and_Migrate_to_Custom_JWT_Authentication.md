These are the errors i got. Please fix those. Not sure why it wants that crypto in there. We don't have anything on our site that will use crypto. I feel like we only need the mongodb information in the env. I am not sure what we used the nextauth for. Is there a way that nextauth isn't needed? We can put the email settings in the backend of the admin panel. I don't think we need the  game server information in the env if we are going to have the backend handle the adding servers like i requested last time. Please see previous chat history on that idea. Can we make it that the database creates the first user as the owner or admin that has access to the admin panel?  Then we can move the discord information to the backend with the option from the owner to use discord integration, steam integration, google integration for the users to login? Maybe toggle options? The steam integration will be used for other things down the line. I also want to make sure we have nothing in our files that says redm/fivem. This is going to be a multi game website when we are done with it. We can just call it community if we have to since it's a community site.  
 I also think we should remove the server api, server address, and server port number. I think we need to add this to the backend in the admin portal when they create a server from there. I also want the server that they create to show up on the front page under Our Servers automatically with the information we already have for that section such as ping rate, player count, etc. I also want an easy way for people to update the site when we push changes to github. Can we do this from the backend of the website itself in the admin section? Maybe an update is available and they can click update? I would like to remove the Deployment Troubleshooting .md and other ways to install the site since we made things easier. To also make things even more interesting. What if we put in the admin panel a way to change the text and anything on the site like a customization for color, pictures, etc, gallery images that show up on the front page in the hero-section.tsx
Also we need to rename the redm/fivem to Community Website - Interactive Installer. When a user presses no during all configuration correct and makes that change and hits done it makes them setup everything again.

## Task State

## Complete Conversation Summary
This conversation focused on resolving critical build errors in a Next.js community website project that was experiencing module resolution issues with authentication systems. The user encountered multiple build failures related to missing '@/lib/auth' modules and 'jsonwebtoken' dependencies, along with deprecated npm package warnings.

The core issue was identified as a conflicting authentication setup where the project was mixing two different authentication systems: NextAuth.js (using `getServerSession` and `authOptions`) and a custom JWT-based authentication system (using `getAuthUser` from '@/lib/auth'). This created import conflicts and build failures across multiple API routes.

**Key Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Authentication System Consolidation**: Systematically replaced all NextAuth.js references with the custom JWT authentication system across all API routes including:
   - `/app/api/admin/servers/route.ts`
   - `/app/api/admin/site-settings/route.ts` 
   - `/app/api/admin/update-check/route.ts`
   - `/app/api/admin/website-settings/route.ts`
   - `/app/api/admin/upload-gallery-image/route.ts`
   - `/app/api/admin/update-website/route.ts`
   - `/app/api/admin/servers/[id]/visibility/route.ts`
   - `/app/api/admin/servers/[id]/route.ts`
   - `/app/api/user/profile-picture/route.ts`
   - `/app/api/admin/users/route.ts`

2. **NextAuth Removal**: Completely removed NextAuth.js dependencies by:
   - Deleting the `/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` file and directory
   - Removing NextAuth type definitions (`/types/next-auth.d.ts`)
   - Updating middleware to use custom JWT verification instead of NextAuth middleware
   - Removing Discord-related API routes that were NextAuth-dependent

3. **Middleware Migration**: Replaced NextAuth middleware with custom JWT-based middleware that:
   - Checks for auth tokens in headers or cookies
   - Verifies JWT tokens using the custom auth system
   - Protects admin routes based on `isAdmin` and `isOwner` flags

4. **Game-Agnostic Updates**: Made initial changes to remove game-specific references (RedM/FiveM) and make the platform more generic for multi-game support, including updating default website settings descriptions.

**User Requirements Identified** (for future implementation):
- Remove crypto dependencies and simplify environment variables to only MongoDB
- Create first user as owner/admin automatically
- Move Discord/Steam/Google integrations to admin panel as toggleable options
- Remove server configuration from environment variables, manage through admin panel
- Implement automatic server display on front page with ping/player count
- Add GitHub update functionality through admin panel
- Create comprehensive site customization options (colors, text, images)
- Rename installer references from "RedM/FiveM" to "Community Website"
- Remove deployment documentation files

**Current Status**: The authentication system migration is largely complete, but build issues persist due to stubborn NextAuth route references that continue to appear despite file deletion attempts. The project structure has been successfully updated to use the custom JWT authentication system throughout, but final build verification is still needed.
