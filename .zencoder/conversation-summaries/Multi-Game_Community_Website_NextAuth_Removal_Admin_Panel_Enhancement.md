I am not sure what we used the nextauth for. Is there a way that nextauth isn't needed? We can put the email settings in the backend of the admin panel. I don't think we need the  game server information in the env if we are going to have the backend handle the adding servers like i requested last time. Please see previous chat history on that idea. Can we make it that the database creates the first user as the owner or admin that has access to the admin panel?  Then we can move the discord information to the backend with the option from the owner to use discord integration, steam integration, google integration for the users to login? Maybe toggle options? The steam integration will be used for other things down the line. I also want to make sure we have nothing in our files that says redm/fivem. This is going to be a multi game website when we are done with it. We can just call it community if we have to since it's a community site.  
 I also think we should remove the server api, server address, and server port number. I think we need to add this to the backend in the admin portal when they create a server from there. I also want the server that they create to show up on the front page under Our Servers automatically with the information we already have for that section such as ping rate, player count, etc. I also want an easy way for people to update the site when we push changes to github. Can we do this from the backend of the website itself in the admin section? Maybe an update is available and they can click update? I would like to remove the Deployment Troubleshooting .md and other ways to install the site since we made things easier. To also make things even more interesting. What if we put in the admin panel a way to change the text and anything on the site like a customization for color, pictures, etc, gallery images that show up on the front page in the hero-section.tsx
Also we need to rename the redm/fivem to Community Website - Interactive Installer. When a user presses no during all configuration correct and makes that change and hits done it makes them setup everything again.

## Complete Conversation Summary
This conversation focused on transforming a RedM/FiveM-specific community website into a comprehensive multi-game platform with enhanced admin capabilities. The user requested several major architectural changes to simplify deployment and improve functionality.

**Key Requirements Addressed:**

1. **Authentication System Overhaul**: Completely removed NextAuth dependency and implemented a custom JWT-based authentication system. Created new auth APIs for login, register, logout, and user management with proper middleware protection for admin routes.

2. **Database-First User Management**: Implemented an initial setup system that creates the first user as the owner/admin automatically. The setup process is now handled through a dedicated `/setup` page that initializes both the admin account and website settings in the database.

3. **Environment Variable Cleanup**: Removed NextAuth-related environment variables and game server configuration from .env.local. The system now only requires MongoDB URI and JWT secret, with all other settings managed through the admin panel.

4. **Multi-Game Platform Transformation**: Systematically removed all RedM/FiveM references throughout the codebase, replacing them with generic "Community Website" branding. Updated the installer name to "Community Website - Interactive Installer."

5. **Enhanced Server Management**: Created a comprehensive server management system in the admin panel that supports multiple game types (FiveM, RedM, Minecraft, Rust, GMod, CS:GO, etc.). Servers added through the admin panel automatically appear on the frontend with real-time status monitoring.

6. **Dynamic Website Customization**: Expanded the website settings system to allow complete customization of colors, text, images, gallery content, and social integrations through the admin panel. The hero section now dynamically loads content from the database.

7. **Auto-Update System**: Implemented GitHub-based auto-update functionality that allows website owners to update their site directly from the admin panel. The system checks for updates and can pull/build/restart automatically.

8. **Integration Management**: Moved Discord, Steam, and Google integration settings to the admin panel with toggle options, allowing owners to enable/disable these features as needed.

**Technical Implementation Details:**

- Created custom authentication library (`/lib/auth.ts`) with JWT token management
- Implemented middleware protection for admin routes
- Built comprehensive admin APIs for server management, user management, and website settings
- Created public APIs for frontend consumption (website settings, server listings)
- Enhanced the admin dashboard with new server management component
- Updated the hero section to use dynamic content from database
- Implemented proper error handling and user feedback throughout

**Files Modified/Created:**
- Authentication system: New auth APIs and middleware
- Server management: Enhanced admin components and APIs
- Website settings: Expanded customization options
- Setup system: Initial installation and configuration
- Documentation: Simplified installation guide, removed deployment troubleshooting

**Current Status:**
The website successfully builds and runs as a multi-game community platform. The initial setup process guides users through creating their admin account and basic configuration. All major functionality has been moved to the admin panel, significantly simplifying deployment and ongoing management. The auto-update system provides an easy way to keep the website current with GitHub changes.
